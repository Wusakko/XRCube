# XRCube

## General
This is Unity base project for XR development. Not rocket science at the moment, but you should check "OtherMaterials/Documentation"-folder for the future (system description pics etc.)

## Current state and setup
It is currently possible to build for PC both SteamVR and Oculus SDK (Not Quest standalone at the moment). Just plug and play! (Ok, you have to select "01Construct" scene from "Scenes"-folder). These are tested with Oculus Quest via Oculus Link (other devices are not yet tested)

## Install for the devices
Protoversion (XRCube v0.3) of this project can be tested as Quest standalone build (.apk): https://urly.fi/1VJY XRCube related videos and list of created realities can be found https://wusakko.com/xrcube

## (Tech) choices
This project is open source and that's why there are no third-party assets used. As you can see from "XRCubeTechTree"-file (*1), OpenXR can lso be used for web developent via WebXR. I think web browsers are not currently ready for immersive XR development and that's why I use Unity game-engine. You don't play games in browser, do you?
