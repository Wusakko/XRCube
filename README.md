# XRCube
Unity project is quite empty at the moment. Meanwhile you can check system process pics in "OtherMaterials/Documentation" folder. And also some media stuff at https://wusakko.com/xrcube and runnable Quest .apk can be found at https://urly.fi/1VJY

It is currently possible to build for PC both SteamVR and Oculus. Just select different platform from Unity Editor --> Edit --> Project Settings --> XR Plug-in Management --> OpenXR --> OpenXR Runtime (Editor Instance Only). These are tested with Oculus Quest and Oculus Link (So other devices are not yet tested)
