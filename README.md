# XRCube
This is Unity base project for XR development. Not rocket science at the moment, but hopefully in the future (check "OtherMaterials/Documentation"-folder for system description pics). 

It is currently possible to build for PC both SteamVR and Oculus SDK (Not Quest standalone at the moment). Just plug and play! (Ok, you have to select "01Construct" scene from "Scenes"-folder). These are tested with Oculus Quest via Oculus Link (other devices are not yet tested)

This project is open source and that's why all third-party assets are not used. But of course I use awsome third-party assets when I create realities with this base. More info can be found: https://wusakko.com/xrcube

Protoversion (XRCube v0.3) of this project can be tested as Quest standalone build (.apk): https://urly.fi/1VJY
